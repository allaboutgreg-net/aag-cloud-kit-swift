# AllAboutGregCloudKit - Cloud API for Swift

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## About

This code is part of a larger project, [All About Greg !](https://allaboutgreg.net). It serves two purposes: first is to run my blog on Firebase / Google Cloud Platform with companions apps, and second, to showcase my skills (if I have any).

`AllAboutGregCloudKit` is a Swift implementation of the cloud API which all Swift based apps will use.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12+, preferably running on macOS 11
- Swift 5
- iOS 14+, macOS 11+
- Firebase iOS SDK 8+

## Getting started

First, on the app project itself (or the framework which the app will use), you need to import [Firebase iOS SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) via Swift Package Manager, as explained [Firebase iOS SDK documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/swift-package-manager?authuser=0).

This kit doesn't initialize Firebase for your app, so you need to follow the steps on the [Firebase iOS documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0).

Then you can use this package in your source code by importing the `AllAboutGregCloudKit` library.

```swift
import AllAboutGregCloudKit
```
